		        <h2>What is an HSPC?</h2>
			<p>
			High School Programming Competitions (HSPCs) are programming competitions hosted by universities 
            where high school students form teams of 2-3 and compete to solve as many programming challenges
             as possible within a set timeframe. These contests test coding skills, problem-solving, and teamwork, 
             and they provide a valuable experience that looks good on college applications. 
             The hosting uuniversity often provides lunch, along with shirts and other items to the attendes.
            They also often reward the top-placing teams with prizes. Past competitions have been hosted by MSU, SVSU, UM Flint, and EMU.
             These competitions are sometimes scheduled during the schoolweek and are are usually an all-day affair.
              Even if you currently have no experience coding, we will make sure that those interested are prepared for the competitions 
              by working through similar coding problems at our meetings leading up to competition dates. Additionally, for new programmers, HSPCs often
              have a novice bracket for those who have had 1 semester or less of CS classes and an experienced bracket for the rest.
              <br><br>
              The next HSPC we will be attending is at The University of Michigan, Flint. <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/hspc">Here</a> is a 
              link to UM Flint's HSPC webpage. Registration is open, so please let Mr. Mattox and the CS Club know that you are interested in 
              participating by filling out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4jw6kyDGRotl5uoSoXtlIaDMxPQCvUJfLoNN55lLlJvwv2g/viewform?usp=sf_link"> form</a>.

			<p>
				The USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) holds 4 annual competitions in 4 levels (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum) each with 3 programs that will 
				push your coding abilities to the next level. Everyone starts in the bronze division and can work their way up the ranks by completing every program 
				in a competition. The competition dates for 2024-2025 have yet to be posted but we will be sure to update the website when they are!
