		        <h2>What is an HSPC?</h2>
			<p>
			High School Programming Competitions (HSPCs) are programming competitions hosted by universities 
            where high school students form teams of 2-3 and compete to solve as many programming challenges
             as possible within a set timeframe. These contests test coding skills, problem-solving, and teamwork, 
             and they provide a valuable experience that looks good on college applications. 
             The hosting university often provides lunch, along with shirts and other items to the attendees.
            They also often reward the top-placing teams with prizes. Past competitions have been hosted by MSU, SVSU, UM Flint, and EMU.
             These competitions are sometimes scheduled during the schoolweek and are are usually an all-day affair.
              Even if you currently have no experience coding, we will make sure that those interested are prepared for the competitions 
              by working through similar coding problems at our meetings leading up to competition dates. Additionally, for new programmers, HSPCs often
              have a novice bracket for those who have had 1 semester or less of CS classes and an experienced bracket for the rest.

		        <h2>What is USACO?</h2>	
			<p>
				The USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) holds 4 annual competitions in 4 levels (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum) each with 3 programs that will 
				push your coding abilities to the next level. Everyone starts in the bronze division and can work their way up the ranks by completing every program 
				in a competition. The competition dates for 2024-2025 have yet to be posted but we will be sure to update the website when they are!
				<br><br>
				For more information regarding rules and to sign up, visit the <a href="https://usaco.org">USACO Website.</a>
				<br><br>
				USACO also has a training program where you can hone your skills by completing programs ranging from very easy to very difficult testing your skills on 
				all different aspects of coding. USACO provides the materials needed to learn the techniques needed to solve the problems as well as an in depth analysis and explanation 
				for each program including multiple solutions to show how others solved it.
